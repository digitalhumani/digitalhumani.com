                        engineer and in DevOps. His inspiration to join the DigitalHumani Team
                        stems from his belief that we humans are responsible for the health of
                        our planet. He joined in as an effort to help conserve the natural
                        environment and fight climate change. If Slawomir could pick up a new
                        skill in an instant, it would be telling jokes that are actually funny.

                        difference, especially in the sphere of climate action, and was looking
                        for a way to give back with his newly learned web development skills.
                        He’s found working as a developer with DigitalHumani to be a great way
                        to learn new technologies and skills in a relaxed and fun environment
                        while contributing to reforestation efforts. If Nik could pick up a new
